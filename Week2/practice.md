# This is a Markdown Example

## Here are some examples:

### Formatting examples:

**This line is bold** but _this line is in italics_

Also, this **word** is bold, and this _word_ is italicized

Guess what? This **_word_** is both bold and italic

~~oops didn't mean to write that~~

_anywho..._

### List Examples:
1. First MD ordered list example
2. Second list example :)
3. Third?

- Unordered list example
- This is cool
- Let's do one more

1. Here comes a nested list o.o
    - Hi there
      - Oh you need another ordered list?
        1.  Here you go lol
2. Let's see some sub-items
    - is there an "i" list item there?
    - I guess not...
      - Let's see if we can get a square
      - noice.
