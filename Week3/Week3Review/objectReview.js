// Below is an object called currentWeather
const currentWeather = {
  weather: "Rain",
  temp: 50,
  sky: "Overcast",
  details: ["Moderate Rain", 45, "Not Severe"]
};

// Print a string that references weather, temp and sky

// Create a variable called weatherDetails and assign it to the string below

// Using a for...of loop, iterate through the array stored in "details". Each iteration of the loop should concatenate the value of the item AND a blank space to the end of the "weatherDetails" string.
// After the for...of loop, print out "weatherDetails"

// The exact output for this should be as shown bellow
// These are the weather details: Moderate Rain 45 Not Severe
